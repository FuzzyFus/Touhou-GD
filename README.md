# Really Cool Touhou Godot Game
### [Play it live here!](https://rokuhime.itch.io/touhou-gd)

This is a recreation of an old Unity project done I made in high school, originally being a minigame for an inside joke named [GTS Simulator](https://rokuhime.itch.io/gts-simulator). Here it is, remade 2 years later with 90% less spaghetti code!

I'm not planning on doing too much more with this project outside of bug fixes, but I may add online multiplayer in the future. We'll see.
